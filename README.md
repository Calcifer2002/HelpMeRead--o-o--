# HelpMeRead--o-o--
A fun app to help people read small text like the ones on the back of groceries!
The app uses the google vision api provided by the ML kit -https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/android
Cropping of images was done using the https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper library
